# Accounts

Adding, naming, and managing the accounts TeamClaude rotates between.

## OAuth login (recommended)

```bash
teamclaude login
```

Opens your browser and uses the same OAuth flow as Claude Code. Auto-detects the account email and subscription tier. Logging in with the same account again updates its credentials.

Run it once per account. You can add accounts while the server is running — press **R** in the TUI to reload.

If the profile cannot be identified, login stops without adding a placeholder
account. Retry after confirming the credential is valid, or pass
`teamclaude login --name <name>` to add it without profile detection.

## Import from Claude Code

If you already have Claude Code set up, import its credentials directly:

```bash
claude /login           # log into an account in Claude Code
teamclaude import       # import its credentials
```

Re-importing the same account updates its credentials. You can also import from a custom path:

```bash
teamclaude import --from /path/to/credentials.json
```

Automatic naming requires a successful profile lookup. If credentials are
invalid or the profile cannot be identified, the import stops without adding a
placeholder account. Pass `--name <name>` to explicitly import without profile
detection.

## Delegating credentials to a file (`importFrom`)

Instead of storing an OAuth account's tokens in `teamclaude.json`, an account entry can name the file to read them from:

```json
{ "name": "me@example.com", "type": "oauth", "importFrom": "~/.claude/.credentials.json" }
```

The tokens (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt`) are read from that file at startup and again on every config reload, so a login refreshed by Claude Code itself is picked up without re-running `teamclaude import`. Every other field on the entry (`priority`, `disabled`, `upstream`, `modelMap`, …) is kept as written. A file with no token skips the account with a message rather than sending an empty credential upstream. `teamclaude import` is the alternative: it copies the tokens into the config once.

## API key

For Anthropic API key accounts (billed via Console):

```bash
teamclaude login --api
```

## Multiple organizations

One email can hold multiple accounts across different organizations (e.g. corp + personal). Dedup is keyed on account + org, and names disambiguate as `email (Org)`.

Pass `--org <name|uuid>` to resolve a bare email when it is ambiguous:

```bash
teamclaude remove user@example.com --org Acme
```

## Managing accounts

```bash
teamclaude accounts             # list accounts with tier and token status
teamclaude accounts -v          # also show token expiry times
teamclaude remove <name>        # remove an account (by name or email)
teamclaude disable <name>       # temporarily exclude it from rotation
teamclaude enable <name>        # re-enable it (also clears a stuck error state)
teamclaude priority <name> 1    # rotation preference, lower = preferred
teamclaude priority <name> --first
teamclaude priority <name> --last
```

`login`, `import`, `enable`, `disable` and `priority` notify a running server to reload, so credential, priority and enable/disable changes are picked up live; the same reload (POST `/teamclaude/reload`, or **R** in the TUI) also applies hand edits to an account's `upstream`/`modelMap`. Account **removals** still need a restart.

Accounts can also be added and removed from the TUI settings screen: **`g`** → **Add account** / **Remove account**.

## The `id` field

Every account entry carries an `id`, added the first time the config is read and written back on the next save. It is what ties an entry to the running account built from it: entries without a usable credential are skipped at startup, so an entry's place in the file is not the account's place in the fleet, and a token refreshed for one account would otherwise be recorded against another.

Hand edits are fine. Leave the `id` alone and it keeps working; delete it and a new one is issued on the next read. If you copy an account block to make a second entry, the duplicated `id` is spotted on the next read and the later of the two gets a fresh one.

## Codex accounts (experimental)

An OpenAI Codex subscription can be pooled alongside your Claude accounts.

```bash
teamclaude login --codex     # browser sign-in, repeat per account
```

Add `--no-browser` to print the URL instead of opening one, and `--name` to
label the account yourself (it defaults to the email on the login).

Each login stores its own tokens and ChatGPT account ID. Startup, reload and
restart preserve that account even when the native Codex login belongs to
someone else or `~/.codex/auth.json` is absent. Re-enrollment updates the same
account ID, removes an old file binding, and notifies the running proxy. Use a
distinct `--name` if another account already uses the requested name.

To pool a login you already have, or to add one without a browser, point an
account at the Codex CLI's own credentials file instead — it defaults to
`~/.codex/auth.json`:

```json
{ "name": "me@example.com", "type": "oauth", "provider": "codex" }
```

The Codex CLI honours `CODEX_HOME`, so several logins can be kept side by side
and pooled with `importFrom`:

```bash
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-second codex login
```

```json
{ "name": "second", "type": "oauth", "provider": "codex",
  "importFrom": "~/.codex-second/auth.json" }
```

Credential sources follow these rules:

- An explicit `importFrom` reads that file, including when stale inline tokens
  remain in the config.
- A `source: "login"` entry or an entry with an `accountId` uses inline
  credentials. A missing token reports an error instead of borrowing the native
  login. Mark hand-inlined credentials with `source: "login"`.
- An unmarked legacy Codex entry without `accountId` defaults to the native
  file. This includes tokens copied into such entries by older TeamClaude
  saves. Loading normalizes the file binding in memory; the next save retains it.

Imported files remain authoritative across restarts. Reload picks up a changed
file but does not restore an unchanged file snapshot over tokens refreshed in
memory. TeamClaude does not write refreshed tokens back to these files. Use
separate `login --codex` grants when native Codex and the pool refresh
independently, as described in [remote access and model routing](codex-remote-access.md).

If an enrolled account ran with the startup substitution bug in issue #7,
re-enroll that pooled account or restore known-good credentials. The proxy
rejects a readable access-token account claim that disagrees with the stored
account ID, both on load and after refresh. Opaque tokens cannot establish that
check. A mismatch discovered only after refresh cannot undo the grant already
sent. Display names do not recover the original credentials.

Then tell Codex to reach TeamClaude instead of OpenAI, in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
model_provider = "teamclaude"

[model_providers.teamclaude]
name = "teamclaude"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3456/backend-api/codex"
wire_api = "responses"
requires_openai_auth = true
```

Keep your native ChatGPT login when using this configuration. Setting
`requires_openai_auth = true` lets Codex expose that account to the desktop app.
TeamClaude still replaces model-request credentials with the selected pooled
account. For a CLI-only setup without a native OpenAI login, `false` permits
unauthenticated requests to the local proxy, but can hide account-dependent
desktop settings. See [desktop authentication](codex-remote-access.md#preserve-desktop-account-settings).

### Codex Desktop remote targets

The native desktop login and the subscription serving model requests can differ. In the tested Mac-to-Linux setup, the remote target stays accessible under its native login while the Linux model provider routes through another separately enrolled TeamClaude subscription. This is intended behavior. Preserve the native login when changing model routing. See [configuration and verification](codex-remote-access.md).

### Through the MITM proxy (no Codex config needed)

MITM mode intercepts `chatgpt.com` as well as `api.anthropic.com`, so a Codex CLI
launched behind the proxy is pooled with no `~/.codex/config.toml` change at all:

```bash
eval "$(teamclaude env)"   # HTTPS_PROXY + NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS
codex
```

Two boundaries worth knowing:

- `chatgpt.com` is intercepted **only when a Codex account is configured**. An
  Anthropic-only fleet tunnels it untouched — intercepting a host nobody asked
  the proxy to read is not a neutral default.
- `ab.chatgpt.com` is never intercepted. It is OpenAI's telemetry endpoint,
  carries no inference, and there is nothing there to rewrite.

The base-URL route below still works and is the way to pool Codex without MITM.

`OPENAI_BASE_URL` does **not** work for this — a ChatGPT-authenticated Codex
ignores it. `model_providers` is the supported redirect.

The `/backend-api/codex` suffix matters. A Codex subscription authenticates
against the ChatGPT backend, not the OpenAI API platform — pointed at
`api.openai.com` the same token is refused with `Missing scopes:
api.responses.write`. Codex appends `/responses` and `/models` to `base_url`,
so this suffix makes it emit exactly the paths the ChatGPT backend expects and
TeamClaude forwards them verbatim.

### How it shares the port with Claude

One listener serves both CLIs, because the request path says which pool of
accounts is eligible: Claude Code posts to `/v1/messages`, Codex posts to
`/backend-api/codex/responses`. An Anthropic account is never offered a Codex
request and vice versa, so the two rotate independently on one port, one config
and one TUI.

### What differs from a Claude account

- The credential is injected as `Authorization: Bearer`, plus a
  `ChatGPT-Account-Id` header. That header is OpenAI's counterpart to the
  `account_uuid` TeamClaude patches into an Anthropic request body — so the
  Codex path performs no body rewrite at all.
- Tokens refresh against `auth.openai.com` using the Codex CLI's own client id.
- The request body is forwarded untouched. This is a passthrough, not a
  translation layer: TeamClaude never converts between the Anthropic and OpenAI
  protocols.

### Quota

Codex reports its limits on every response, and TeamClaude normalises them into
the same fields the Anthropic path fills — so the switch threshold, reset
countdowns and the TUI's quota bars work for Codex accounts too, and rotation
happens *before* upstream refuses rather than after a 429.

Two details are worth knowing if you read the raw headers:

- Limits arrive in families. The unnamed one is the account-wide limit; a family
  carrying `-limit-name` is model-scoped, the counterpart of Anthropic's Fable
  weekly bucket.
- `primary` and `secondary` are positions, not durations — the account-wide
  family can put its 7-day window in `primary` while a model-scoped family puts
  a 5-hour window there. Windows are classified by their stated
  `window-minutes`, never by position.

With `teamclaude probe 300`, the background prober also reads Codex subscription usage without generating a completion. It uses the same duration-based window mapping and keeps idle accounts current. The dashboard displays these readings, [detected resets, and banked reset credits](reset-tracking.md).

## Third-party backend accounts

Any Anthropic-compatible API can be added as an account alongside your Claude accounts. Give it a higher `priority` value (lower = preferred, so use e.g. `100`) and it will be used as a fallback when all Claude accounts are exhausted.

```json
{
  "name": "deepseek",
  "type": "oauth",
  "accessToken": "sk-your-deepseek-api-key",
  "upstream": "https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic",
  "priority": 100,
  "modelMap": {
    "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001": "deepseek-v4-flash",
    "claude-sonnet-4-6": "deepseek-v4-pro[1m]"
  }
}
```

- **`upstream`** — base URL of the target API. Requests are sent to `upstream + /v1/messages` (etc.) for this account only.
- **`modelMap`** — when a Claude model name arrives in the request body, it is rewritten to the mapped name before forwarding.

Where the provider publishes one, its own balance or quota is shown in `teamclaude status` — see [third-party backend quota](quota.md#third-party-backend-quota).

Reserve the backend for sessions that explicitly ask for its models with a [route](routing.md#model-routes):

```json
{ "name": "deepseek", "match": ["deepseek-*"], "accounts": ["deepseek"] }
```

Then pick the model at launch, or with `/model` inside a session:

```bash
# This session routes to DeepSeek; all other sessions still use Claude accounts.
claude --model 'deepseek-v4-pro[1m]'
```

Model names with brackets (e.g. `deepseek-v4-pro[1m]`) must be quoted in the shell.

### `accounts[].models` is deprecated

The older per-account `models` list still works, but use a [route](routing.md#model-routes) instead. Routes are more flexible (glob matching, multiple accounts, bucket override) and less surprising: a `models` list changes eligibility across the *whole fleet* — once any account claims a model, every account that doesn't claim it is skipped for that model. The server prints a deprecation notice at startup naming the route to replace it with, and the field may be removed in a future version.
