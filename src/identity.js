// Account identity helpers.
//
// An OAuth account is identified by its Anthropic account UUID (the *person*)
// plus the organization it is scoped to. The same email/person can belong to
// multiple organizations — e.g. a corporate Pro org and a personal Max org —
// each with its own OAuth token and quota. The org must therefore be part of
// the identity; otherwise multi-org logins overwrite each other, removals match
// the wrong entry, and token rotation persists onto the wrong account.
//
// The org discriminator prefers the org UUID but falls back to the org name
// (the profile endpoint has always returned a name), so identity still works on
// entries created before org UUIDs were stored.
