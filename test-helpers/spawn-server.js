// with closedPort(), write it into a throwaway config and poll
// /teamclaude/status until something answered. `node --test` runs files in
// parallel, so between the probe closing and the child's listen() another test
// (or anything else on the machine) could take the port. Two outcomes, both
// seen in CI and locally under load: the child exits with "Port N is already
// in use" and the test times out with a confusing error; or, worse, ANOTHER
// server answers on that port — a neighbouring test's in-process
// createProxyServer, say, which has no hooks.reload — the 200 satisfies the
// poll, and the test then talks to the wrong server (reload → 501). Readiness
// here is a status reply whose `server.pid` is the child's own, and a child
// that lost the port to a neighbour is respawned on a fresh one.
