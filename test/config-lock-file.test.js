// The server (token refresh), the CLI (login/import/priority/...) and a GUI
// client all rewrite the config with a temp+rename. Two of them racing keep only
// the later write, and the edit that is lost is as likely as not a freshly
// rotated refresh token — which costs a re-login. Writers therefore hold an
// advisory lock file, `<config>.lock`, across the read-modify-write. These pin
// the protocol other clients interoperate with: exclusive create, a JSON body
// of {pid, at}, staleness by age or dead pid, a bounded wait, and that the lock
// is advisory — a writer that cannot get it still writes.

// `lockWaitMs` is the wait budget for the run, when a test's assertions depend
// on it: a test that must observe a release before the budget runs out gets a
// budget no scheduler stall can exhaust; a test of the budget itself gets a
// short one, so it is fast and its lower bound is the only timing it asserts.
