Multi-account proxy for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) and [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex): it pools Claude Max, ChatGPT/Codex, API-key and third-party backend accounts, and rotates on quota.

It sits between the coding agent and the provider's API, holds several accounts, and moves to the next one when the current account gets close to its session or weekly limit. The session keeps running instead of stopping on a 429. Claude accounts serve Claude Code, Codex accounts serve the Codex CLI, and both pools share one proxy.

This is the [MOT fork](https://github.com/mot-group/teamclaude) of [KarpelesLab/teamclaude](https://github.com/KarpelesLab/teamclaude). It adds a persistent LAN dashboard, Codex quota probes, reset history, banked reset inventory, Google Chat alerts, and an opt-in Fable quota preference. See [our changes and fixes](docs/fork-changes.md) for merged PRs and deployment limits. The npm badge above refers to the upstream package.

## Added in this fork

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| [Password-protected LAN dashboard](docs/lan-dashboard.md) | Separate Claude and Codex routing summaries, account capacity, activity, token totals, tracked Claude sessions, and diagnostics. Password gate and a persistent Linux service. |
| [Codex quota probes](docs/quota.md#codex-subscription-probes) | Read-only usage checks for idle subscriptions, including weekly primary windows and model-specific limits. |
| [Reset tracking and Google Chat](docs/reset-tracking.md) | Restarted windows, quota refills, scheduled rollovers, banked Codex credits with expiry, and persistent notification delivery. |
| [Fable quota preference](docs/routing.md#prefer-accounts-with-depleted-fable-quota) | Use Fable-depleted accounts for other Claude models while preserving eligible accounts for Fable. Off by default. |
| [Codex Desktop remote access](docs/codex-remote-access.md) | Intended behavior: retain the native remote-target login while model requests use another subscription through TeamClaude. |

## Quick start

Node.js 20+ required. The runtime uses Node built-ins only, so no `npm install` step is needed to run a source checkout. Install development dependencies only if you need the lint tooling.

For a new source checkout of this fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mot-group/teamclaude.git
cd teamclaude
node src/index.js login     # browser OAuth, run it once per Claude account
node src/index.js login --codex  # optional Codex subscription
TEAMCLAUDE_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE=1 node src/index.js server
# In another terminal, from this checkout:
node src/index.js run
```

The command reference uses `teamclaude`; from a source checkout, substitute `node src/index.js`. The upstream `npm install -g @karpeleslab/teamclaude` command does not select this fork. Existing installations with local provider guards must preserve those overlays when updating. See [deployment boundaries](docs/fork-changes.md#deployment-boundaries-and-known-limits).

Already logged into Claude Code? `teamclaude import` takes its credentials instead of a fresh OAuth round. API keys, and one email holding accounts in several orgs, are covered in [docs/accounts.md](docs/accounts.md).

## What it does

- Rotates to the next account when the 5h session or 7d weekly bucket reaches the threshold (98% by default), preferring the account whose weekly quota resets soonest.
- Tracks the per-model weekly cap separately, so an account out of Fable quota is skipped for Fable requests and still serves Opus and Sonnet.
- Tells a spent quota bucket apart from a per-minute rate limit and only rotates on the first one. Rotating on a rate limit would just move the burst to the next account and drop the warm cache, so it paces the same account instead.
- Paces requests onto a freshly switched account, so a herd of agents failing over at the same instant doesn't throttle it and cascade down the fleet.
- TUI with quota bars, reset countdowns, activity log, and settings you can change while it runs, including adding and removing accounts.
- Catches hardcoded `api.anthropic.com` endpoints (the Claude Design MCP, for one) through a local MITM forward proxy, not only what `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` covers.
- Holds the request open until quota resets instead of returning 429 when every account is spent, so an unattended run finishes on its own (`holdSeconds`, off by default).
- Refreshes OAuth tokens before they expire and writes them back to config. Client refreshes pass through untouched.
- Pools OpenAI Codex subscriptions alongside Claude accounts (experimental): the Codex CLI is routed through the same proxy, by config or transparently through the MITM proxy, and rotates on its own quota.
- Takes any Anthropic-compatible API (DeepSeek, GLM) as a low-priority fallback for when the Claude accounts are done.
- No dependencies. Node built-ins only.

## Everyday commands

```bash
teamclaude accounts          # accounts with tier and token status
teamclaude status            # live proxy status, needs a running server
teamclaude disable <name>    # pause an account without removing it
teamclaude priority <name> 1 # rotation order, lower = preferred
teamclaude alias --install   # make plain `claude` go through the proxy
teamclaude help              # everything else
```

## Configuration

Config is at `~/.config/teamclaude.json` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honoured) and is meant to be hand-editable. A proxy API key is generated on first use. Observed quota goes to a separate `teamclaude.state.json` next to it, safe to delete since quota gets re-learned from traffic.

Detected resets and queued Chat notifications use a separate private file, defaulting to `teamclaude.json.resets.json`. Deleting it loses reset counts, history, and pending notifications. Keep the webhook URL in a private runtime file. See [reset configuration](docs/reset-tracking.md#google-chat-notifications).

Every field, plus environment variables and network tuning: [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## How it works

1. Claude Code talks to the local proxy instead of `api.anthropic.com`.
2. The proxy picks an eligible account, injects that account's real token, and rewrites `account_uuid` in the body to match.
3. `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` response headers feed the session (5h) and weekly (7d) quota view, which survives a restart.
4. At the threshold, rotation moves on. On a quota 429 the request is resent on another account, so the client never sees the limit while some account still has headroom.
5. Expiring tokens, transient network errors and client token refreshes are handled inside the proxy, so none of them interrupt the session.

## Security

The upstream sources are [KarpelesLab/teamclaude](https://github.com/KarpelesLab/teamclaude) and the [`@karpeleslab/teamclaude`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@karpeleslab/teamclaude) npm package. MOT maintains this source fork separately and does not publish a separate npm package. TeamClaude is **never** distributed as a downloadable binary archive, so be wary of soft-forks that bundle a `.zip` and tell you to extract and run it. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details and how to report issues.

## Compliance

TeamClaude is a local proxy holding your own credentials and driving your own Claude Code CLI. How that lines up with Anthropic's terms, including the multi-subscription question people ask most, is written up in [docs/compliance.md](docs/compliance.md). Not legal advice.
